## Teapot Not Found Poker

The game is a variation of video poker, and an entry for the 2020 Js13kGames coding golf. The 2020 theme is "404". That's where it took its name and slightly tweaked rules.   

### Gameplay

As the game related  to **404**, it's quite logical 🙂 that pair of Fours or less don't count.
Your initial balance is **411**, and you need to reach **418** and officially become a teapot. If you get down to **404**, your balance is not found and you lose.

## Paytable
- Fours or Better - 1
- Two Pair - 2
- Three of a Kind - 3
